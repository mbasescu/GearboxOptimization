function [ke, failed] = stepRatio(firstInstance, gearData, failState)
% stepRatio(storeFirst, gearData) -
%
% This function takes three inputs:
% 
% - 'firstInstance' is a boolean (0 or 1) describing whether or not this
% function is being called from a higher level function, or whether it is
% recursing
% - 'gearData' is a matrix containing a set of gear data and corresponding
% kinetic energies for each gear in the set.  Refer to 'main.m' for
% detailed description of format
% - 'failState' is a 1x2 row vector describing if the first or second set
% of gears in the current gearData fails due to stress.  If calling this
% function from a higher level function (i.e. not recursing), pass in
% anything for this vector, but make sure to set firstInstance to 1
%
% Once finished recursing, this function returns 'ke', the minimum value of kinetic energy it has
% achieved before leaving this level of recursion (popping back up to the
% next highest parameter).
